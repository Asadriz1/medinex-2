## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Development

This project uses Expo Router for navigation with file-based routing. The main screens are located in the `app` directory:

- `home.tsx`: Main dashboard with quick actions
- `calendar/index.tsx`: Calendar view of all medications
- `history/index.tsx`: Medication history log
- `refills/index.tsx`: Refill tracking
- `menstrual-tracker.tsx`: Menstrual cycle tracking

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Expo
- Expo Router
- AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- Linear Gradient for UI elements

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
